## 🎨 UX / UI Philosophy — *Breakthrough UX*
- **Design principle**: clarity first → minimum cognitive load, maximum delight.  
- **Breakthrough UX** = combine data-driven decisions (analytics + user testing) with design patterns that scale across devices.  
- Deliverables I provide: component-based Design System (Figma), interactive prototypes, micro-interactions, accessibility checks, and performance budgets for mobile.
